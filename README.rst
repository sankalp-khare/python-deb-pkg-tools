The Python package `deb-pkg-tools` is a collection of functions to work with
Debian packages and repositories. Some of those functions have a command line
interface (see below) because they're very convenient to use in shell scripts,
while other functions are meant to be called directly from Python code. It's
currently tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.4.

Please note that `deb-pkg-tools` is quite opinionated about how Debian binary
packages should be built and it enforces some of these opinions on its users.
Most of this can be avoided with optional function arguments and/or environment
variables. If you find something that doesn't work to your liking and you can't
work around it, feel free to ask for an additional configuration option; I try
to keep an open mind about the possible use cases of my projects.

Status
------

On the one hand the `deb-pkg-tools` package is based on my experiences with
Debian packages and repositories over the past couple of years, on the other
hand `deb-pkg-tools` itself is quite young. Then again most functionality is
covered by automated tests; at the time of writing coverage is around 90% (some
of the error handling is quite tricky to test if we also want to test the
non-error case, which is of course the main focus :-)

Installation and usage
----------------------

You can install the `deb-pkg-tools` package using the following command::

    $ pip install deb-pkg-tools
    
If your pip (and python) install is provided by `_pyenv`_ then you must do a ``pyenv rehash`` in order for the binaries to appear in your ``$PATH``.

After installation you'll have the ``deb-pkg-tools`` program available::

    $ deb-pkg-tools --help
    Usage: deb-pkg-tools [OPTIONS]

    Supported options:

      -i, --inspect=FILE          inspect the metadata in a *.deb archive
      -b, --build=DIR             build a Debian package with `dpkg-deb --build'
      -u, --update-repo=DIR       create/update a trivial package repository
      -a, --activate-repo=DIR     enable `apt-get' to install packages from a
                                  trivial repository (requires root/sudo privilege)
      -d, --deactivate-repo=DIR   cleans up after --activate-repo
                                  (requires root/sudo privilege)
      -w, --with-repo=DIR CMD...  create/update a trivial package repository,
                                  activate the repository, run the positional
                                  arguments as an external command (usually `apt-get
                                  install') and finally deactivate the repository
      -v, --verbose               make more noise
      -h, --help                  show this message and exit

One thing to note is that the operation of ``deb-pkg-tools --update-repo`` can
be influenced by a configuration file. For details about this, please refer to
the documentation on `deb_pkg_tools.repo.select_gpg_key()`_.

If you're interested in using `deb-pkg-tools` as a Python module, please refer
to the function reference on `Read the Docs`_.

Dependencies
------------

The `deb-pkg-tools` package depends on the python-debian_ package for control
file parsing (it will be automatically installed as a dependency). The
following external programs are also required (depending on which functionality
you need of course):

=====================  =============
Program                Package
=====================  =============
``apt-ftparchive``     ``apt-utils``
``apt-get``            ``apt``
``cp``                 ``coreutils``
``dpkg-deb``           ``dpkg``
``dpkg-architecture``  ``dpkg-dev``
``du``                 ``coreutils``
``fakeroot``           ``fakeroot``
``gpg``                ``gnupg``
``gzip``               ``gzip``
``lintian``            ``lintian``
=====================  =============

The majority of these programs/packages will already be installed on most
Debian based systems so you should only need the following to get started::

    $ sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev fakeroot lintian

Platform compatibility
----------------------

Several things can be tweaked via environment variables if they don't work for
your system or platform. For example on Mac OS X the ``cp`` command doesn't
have an ``-l`` parameter and the ``root`` user and group may not exist, but
despite these things it can still be useful to test package builds on Mac OS
X. The following environment variables can be used to adjust such factors:

==============================  =============  ================================
Variable                        Default        Description
==============================  =============  ================================
``DPT_CHOWN_FILES``             ``true``       Normalize ownership of files
                                               during packaging.
``DPT_ROOT_USER``               ``root``       During package builds the
                                               ownership of all directories and
                                               files is reset to this user.
``DPT_ROOT_GROUP``              ``root``       During package builds the
                                               ownership of all directories and
                                               files is reset to this group.
``DPT_RESET_SETGID``            ``true``       Reset sticky bit on directories
                                               inside package templates before
                                               building.
``DPT_ALLOW_FAKEROOT_OR_SUDO``  ``true``       Run commands using either
                                               fakeroot or sudo (depending on
                                               which is available).
``DPT_SUDO``                    ``true``       Enable the usage of ``sudo``
                                               during operations that normally
                                               require elevated privileges.
``DPT_HARD_LINKS``              ``true``       Allow the usage of hard links to
                                               speed up file copies between
                                               directories on the same file
                                               system.
``DPT_FORCE_ENTROPY``           ``false``      Force the system to generate
                                               entropy based on disk I/O.
``SHELL``                       ``/bin/bash``  Shell to use for the
                                               ``deb-pkg-tools --with-repo``
                                               command.
==============================  =============  ================================

Environment variables for boolean options support the strings ``yes``,
``true``, ``1``, ``no``, ``false`` and ``0`` (case is ignored).

Disabling sudo usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To disable any use of ``sudo`` you can use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   export DPT_ALLOW_FAKEROOT_OR_SUDO=false
   export DPT_CHOWN_FILES=false
   export DPT_RESET_SETGID=false
   export DPT_SUDO=false
